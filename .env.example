# How Precise do you want the transcripts?
# lower    = int8: typically fastest, can run on CPU or GPU, might require specific hardware support for best performance.
# medium   = float16:faster on compatible GPUs, requires CUDA (if no CUDA then defaults to auto).
# standard = float32: often slower but more precise.
# auto     = automatically determine which is going to output the best results.
# lower, medium, standard, auto
